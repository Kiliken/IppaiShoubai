- goal is to reach a set amount of money
- game over when you run out of money, have no items in inventory, or can't afford anything from the shop
- must buy or sell something to go to the next shop
- prices of items being sold by the shops vary 
- shops buy certain items with a high price and some with a low price, this is shown in the current shop as a forecast

ART:
- draw some shopkeepers
- move inventory position
